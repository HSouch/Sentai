Sentai is a general physics package written in python. It has been created to serve as a base environment to facilitate work in a university-level computational physics course.

### Sentai has the following features:

* Vectors and vector operations.
* Dynamic Bodies and collision support.
* Leap-frog N-body simulation (work in progress)
  * Random Body Generation
  * Default environments, such as the solar system.
* Custom plot generation with Matplotlib
  
### Future Plans Include:
* N-Body Simulation with Barnes-Hut Methods (for O(nlog(n)) simulation speed)
* Astrophysics / Cosmology Functions
* Lens Modeling
